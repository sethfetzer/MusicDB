MusicDB
=======

Pulled a Code Project from Ted Faison called Music Explorer that needs a full overhaul.  First order of business is get it running again (no more errors), then put it on a webservice, then add a repository for users to add albums to their accounts, with inter-searchability.  If I get that far, we'll see what happens after that.
